# About MakeWxs

MakeWxs aims to speed up working with the [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/).

It enables partial automation of creating .wxs source files containing the installation components and the directory structure and defining the main .wxs source file containing the Package element and the .wixproj. The program was created originally for the author's personal use and to avoid using more complex tools (like the [HeatWave](https://www.firegiant.com/wix/heatwave/)).


**IMPORTANT**: This project **is not** related to the WiX Toolset development in any way and does not use it. 

You can download MakeWxs msi installer for Windows on the author's [webpage](jstrouhal.wordpress.com). 
After installation, you can run the MakeWxs.exe in the installation folder.
