MakeWxs aims to speed up working with the [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) together with [msbuild](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/). It enables a partiall automation of creation of .wxs source files containing the installation components and the directory structure and also to define the main .wxs source file containg the Package element and the .wixproj.

This project **is not** related to the WiX Toolset development in any way.
