# About MakeWxs

MakeWxs aims to speed up working with the [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) together with [msbuild](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/). It enables partial automation of creating .wxs source files containing the installation components and the directory structure and defining the main .wxs source file containing the Package element and the .wixproj.

This project **is not** related to the WiX Toolset development in any way.
